			<p> <b><u>OUR VISION</u></b>:- This college does not become merely a training centre to train students to answer a few selected 
            questions but an institution with a vision committed to the all round development of the students so that they 
            emerge as good as well as successful human beings. 2. Again, It intends to become a state-of-the-art-technical 
            institution to develop technical expertise among the students who will satisfy all stakeholders and enhance economic
             growth of our nation.<br><br>

            <b><u>OUR MISSION</u></b>:- Our students excel in every field of life. Every effort shall be made to keep this tradition alive.
             Setting a goal in life and achieving it are two different things. It is the achievement of the goal that requires 
             single minded devotion and dedication as well as literally burning the midnight oil for its realization. In addition
              to improving academic excellence, we have been organizing a variety of co-curricular activities for all round development
               of the personality of the students. Our goal is to continuously improve the healthy learning environment and to achieve
                academic excellence for employability as world class technocrats and entrepreneurs.
